# Preliminary Results

The average log predictive score of each model mentioned in section \@ref(model) is calculated and presented in Table \ref{tab:1}. If only one model can be chosen, the model with the highest score will be preferred, which is the ETS(M,A,N) model with a score of -5.8351 in this case. The differences among models seem to be small, disregarding the linear model on the level of S&P 500 returns, but they are closely related to the number of out-of-sample observations and the effect of natural logarithm. Taking these into consideration, the ETS(M,A,N) model could be strongly favored.

Besides, there are 10 pairs of two-model combinations given 5 models. For each combination, I generated all the average log predictive scores when the weight on the first model in that combination increases from 0 to 1 by a 0.01 change every time. The optimal combination is generated according to section \@ref(evaluation). Table \ref{tab:2} presents the information about the optimal combination of every pair, including the highest log score and the optimal weight.

More specifically, I picked the first 4 highest score as shown in Table \ref{tab:3}.
