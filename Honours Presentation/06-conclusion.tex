 \begin{enumerate}
     \item Forecast combinations can deliver \textbf{improved accuracy} over single models, but are \textbf{not necessarily superior} to forecasts obtained from the equally weighted combination.
     \vspace{5mm}
     \item In most cases the optimal weight is "close to" the equal-weighted benchmark.
 \end{enumerate}
