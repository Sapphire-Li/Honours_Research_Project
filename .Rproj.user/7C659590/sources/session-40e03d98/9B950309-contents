# Discussion

## Research Objective



# Conclusion


We focused on the combination of two individual forecasts for two reasons, which in most cases apply for the prediction of business figures in enterprises. Typically, a judgmental forecast and one that is derived using purely statistical means are available and corporate planning can be based on one of the forecast or a combination of both forecasts, where additional forecasts cannot be expected to introduce as much additional information. Furthermore, focusing on the two-forecast case allowed us to provide a variety of in-depth analyses. The challenge of extending the model and the decision boundaries to a larger, arbitrary number of forecasts is subject to future research.

This step, while important, is sizeable and we leave it to future work.
