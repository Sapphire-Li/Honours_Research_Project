# Methodology

The first goal is to combine any two parametric and suitable models for a given dataset in a linear way. Then, I will show that the forecast combinations indeed improve the forecast accuracy by assessing the log predictive score function.

Before explaining the details, I introduce the following notations used throughout the paper. For a probability density measure $p$, a vector time series $\pmb{y}_t$ and its past information $\pmb{Y}_{t-1}$, I use $p(\pmb{y}_t|\pmb{Y}_{t-1})$ to represent the probability density for $\pmb{y}_t$ with known history until $t-1$. 

The unknown parameters are denoted as a vector $\pmb{\theta}$ and the two-model prediction pool is denoted as $\pmb{M}=\{M_1, M_2\}$ .


Assuming that the sample has $T$ available observations, it will be partitioned into two periods with rough proportion, $R$ in-sample periods and $P$ out-of-sample periods, where $R+P=T$.



## Forecast Combination Method

Following section 1.2 of @GA11, the forecasts are based on a two-model linear pool $M$ of two constituent predictive densities $M_1$ and $M_2$:

\begin{equation}
p(\pmb{y}_t|\pmb{Y}_{t-1},M) = wp(\pmb{y}^{obs}_t|\pmb{Y}_{t-1},M_1) + (1-w)p(\pmb{y}^{obs}_t|\pmb{Y}_{t-1},M_2)
\end{equation}



$p(\pmb{y}_t|\pmb{Y}_{t-1},M_j), \ j=1,2,...,J$ where $J$ is the total number of considered models

$M_1$ and $M_2$ where $M_1\ne M_2$. The  two-model pool is then defined as $M=\{M_1, M_2\}$.

the weighted linear combinations of two different prediction models will be evaluated via the log predictive scoring rule.

The methods were less popular in academic circles until  @FZMP23 introduced a state space formulation of some of the methods, which was extended in @HKSG02 to cover the full range of exponential smoothing methods.
