# Methodology

The first goal of this paper is to construct linear density forecast combinations with parametric models. In addition to point forecasts, the use of density forecasts can offer forecasters or decision markers a broader and more comprehensive view of the target variable (see section 2.6.1. of @FTP22 for related contributions). The results are anticipated to reveal that forecast combinations can **deliver improved accuracy over single models, but are not necessarily superior to forecasts obtained from the equally weighted combination.


Before explaining the details, the following notations will be used throughout the paper. A vector time series $\textbf{y}_t$ with a total of $T$ observations will be divided proportionally into two parts, an in-sample period $R$ and an out-of-sample period $P$. The realization of a target variable $y$ at time $t$ is denoted as $y_{t}$. Its future value after the in-sample period is denoted as $y_{\small{R+h}}$, where $h$ is the forecast horizon and $h>0$. The information set at time t, $\mathcal{F}_t$, is comprised of all observed (and known) realizations of $y$ up to time t, i.e., $\mathcal{F}_t = \{y_1, y_2, .., y_t\}$. A prediction model $M$ determines the conditional probability density for $\textbf{y}_t$ with unknown parameters $\theta_M$ given the history $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$, denoted by $f(y_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}, \theta_M, M)$.


## Forecast Combination Method

### Log predictive socre function

We use the log predictive score functions to assess individual models and model combinations.

Parameter estimates $\hat\theta_M$ are obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function of the conditional probability density for the in-sample period, i.e., $\hat\theta_M = argmax \sum^R_{t=1} log f(y_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}, M)$

For the first step, I will estimate the unknown parameters of each constituent model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. These estimates will then be held fixed and substituted into their corresponding probability density functions.

Based on the idea of linear pooling [@BG69;@HM07;@GA11], the linear combinations of two predictive densities $f^{(t)}$ will be constructed with two constituent predictive densities $f^{(t)}_1$ and $f^{(t)}_2$:

\begin{equation}
f^{(t)}(y) = wf^{(t)}_1(y) + (1-w)f^{(t)}_2(y)
\end{equation}  

where $f^{(t)}_1(y)$ and $f^{(t)}_2(y)$ are assumed to follow the normal distributions but with different means and variances, $h$ is the future value after the in-sample period ($R$), and $w$ is the weight allocated to the first model. Through this construction, the sum of two weights is implied to be 1, which is necessary and sufficient for the combination to be a density function[@GA11].

More specifically, $f^{(t)}_1(y)=f_1(y_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})=N\{y_t; \mu_1, \sigma^2_1\}$ and $f^{(t)}_2(y)=f_2(y_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})=N\{y_t; \mu_2, \sigma^2_2\}$. $N\{x; \mu, \sigma^2\}$ denotes the normal probability density function evaluated at value $x$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Given $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$, the conditional mean and conditional variance should be used.



## Evaluation of Models and Weighted Forecast Combinations {#evaluation}

This refers to the second step, where I estimate the weight that is assigned to the first model given the aforementioned estimates. The assessment of out-of-sample predictions for individual models and combinations will rely on the average log predictive score function.

The average log predictive score function of a specific model over the forecast horizon $h=1,2,...,P$ (i.e., the out-of-sample period) is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
LS = \frac{1}{P}\sum^P_{h=1}logf(y_{\small{R+h}}) = \frac{1}{P}\sum^P_{h=1} logf(y_{\small{R+h}}| \mathcal{F}_{\small{R+h-1}})
\end{equation}


The optimal weight $w*$ will be estimated by maximizing the average logarithmic predictive score function over the out-of-sample period:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{P}\sum^P_{h=1}log\Big[wf_1(y_{\small{R+h}}|\mathcal{F}_{\small{R+h-1}}) + (1-w)f_2(y_{\small{R+h}}|\mathcal{F}_{\small{R+h-1}})\Big]
\end{equation}  

The corresponding forecast density combination, given the optimal weight, will be referred to as the optimal combination.


## A Motivating Example

We focused on the combination of two individual forecasts for two reasons, which in most cases apply for the prediction of business figures in enterprises. Typically, a judgmental forecast and one that is derived using purely statistical means are available and corporate planning can be based on one of the forecast or a combination of both forecasts, where additional forecasts cannot be expected to introduce as much additional information. Furthermore, focusing on the two-forecast case allowed us to provide a variety of in-depth analyses. The challenge of extending the model and the decision boundaries to a larger, arbitrary number of fore- casts is subject to future research.

### Data  

Reconsidering the example in section 3 of @GA11, I use the daily Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 index from February 11, 2013 to February 10, 2023 (10 years in total), retrieved via the @SP500. Total 2519 ($T$) available observations are partitioned into two periods with a rough proportion. The in-sample period contains the first 60% of the data ($R = 1511$), which is used for estimating unknown parameters in each model. The remaining 40% ($P = 1008$) becomes the out-of-sample period for further evaluation.  



### Model Specification {#model}

For simplicity, I use five prediction models to study the performance of two-model pools: 

1. Model 1: An ARIMA(1,1,1) model with an intercept for the natural logarithm of S&P 500. 
2. Model 2: An ETS(M,N,N) model for the S&P 500. 
3. Model 3: An ETS(M,A,N) model for the S&P 500. 

ARIMA is short for autoregressive integrated moving average, and ETS stands for exponential smoothing. All error terms are assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean zero and variance $\sigma_m^2 \ \text{for}\  m = 1,2,3$.

4. Model 4: A linear regression model for the S&P 500 with a trend regressor and errors, follow an ARIMA(1,0,0) process. 
5. Model 5: A linear regression model for the natural logarithm of S&P 500 with a trend regressor and errors follow an ARIMA(1,0,0) process. 

Both error terms in the ARIMA model are assumed to be independent and normally distributed with mean zero and variance $\sigma_m^2 \ \text{for}\  m = 4,5$.


All unknown parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood function using the in-sample period data. Once the estimated are obtained, they are held fixed for the density evaluations. For each model, I generate the predictive densities at every future time point of S&P 500 returns ($h=1,2,...,P$) given that all past information is known. In order to make a comparison between each pair of these models, the log of S&P 500 returns will be "back-transformed" by evaluating with the log normal density function.


As a reference, detailed formulas and explanations of these models can be found in @fpp3. The formula of the conditional variance for the ETS models in this case is discussed in Chapter 6.3 of @HKOS08. All coding is performed using R Statistical Software (version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)). The packages used are `tidyverse` [@tidy19], `dplyr` [@dplyr23], and `fpp3` [@fpp23].
