# Introduction 

## Research Objective

This thesis aims to investigate the determinants behind, and evidence for the forecast combination puzzle in various domains, and to empirically examine a general solution to the forecast combination puzzle. The combination puzzle refers to the well-known empirical finding that an equally weighted combination of forecasts generally outperforms more sophisticated combination schemes. This phenomenon is often found in the point combinations but it also appears in the density combinations. In this project, we will work with the density distribution and point forecasts are implicitly included. Over the past 50 years, the empirical studies undertaken so far have focused more on different time series settings. Thus, one of the main contributions of this research will be to investigate the presence of the combination puzzle in settings outside of pure time series models with density forecasts. As an additional contribution, we will assess the veracity, and applicability, of a recently proposed solution to the forecast combination puzzle suggested in @ZMFP22 and @FZMP23. 



## Literature Review and Motivation

The accuracy of forecasts is of critical concern for forecasters and decision makers. An idea of combining multiple forecasts from different models was originally proposed in the seminal work of @BG69. With the evidence of dramatic improvements in the forecast accuracy, forecast combinations have attracted increasing attention and contributions in the literature, both theoretical and applied [@C89;@T06]. In short, forecast combination methods involve producing point or density forecasts and then combining them based on a rule or weighting scheme. This process can sometimes capture more meaningful characteristics of the true data generating process than using a single model, and allow us to combine the best features of different models within a single framework. Researchers have examined a variety of combination methods for point and density forecasts over the past 50 years, see @WHLK22 for a modern literature review.  



In most time series setting under which forecast combinations are employed, a striking empirical phenomenon is often observed, coined by @SW04, as the "forecast combination puzzle". The puzzle is encapsulated by the fact that "theoretically sophisticated weighting schemes should provide more benefits than the sample average from forecast combination, while empirically the simple average has been continuously found to dominate more complicated approaches to combining forecasts" [@WHLK22]. In the literature, there are two possible explanations for the puzzle. One concentrates on the estimation uncertainty and instability in combination weight like in @SW98, @SW04 and @SW09. Another one explores the trade-off between bias and variance as in @E11 and @CMVW16. Recently, @ZMFP22 and @FZMP23 proposed a new aspect of explanation by investigating the sampling variability in model estimation. They illustrated that, asymptotically, the bias and variability mainly come from the estimation of forecasts.



The goal of this thesis is two-fold: first, to search for empirical evidence of the combination puzzle in settings outside of the usual time series in which it has been found; second, to test the empirical veracity of the theoretical solution to the puzzle found in @FZMP23, both within, and outside of, the standard time series setting where the puzzle is often observed.
