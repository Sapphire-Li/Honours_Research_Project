Exponential smoothing was originally developed in the late 1950s \autocite{Brown59,Brown63,Holt57,Winters60}. Because of their computational simplicity and interpretability, they became widely used in practice.

Empirical studies by \textcite{MH79} and \textcite{Metal82} found little difference in forecast accuracy between exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. This made the family of exponential smoothing procedures an attractive proposition \autocite[see][]{CKOS01}.

The methods were less popular in academic circles until \textcite{OKS97} introduced a state space formulation of some of the methods, which was extended in \textcite{HKSG02} to cover the full range of exponential smoothing methods.

Let's assume future advertising spend and GDP are at the current levels. Then forecasts for the next year are given in Table \ref{tab:salesforecasts}.

\{r salesforecasts, results=``asis''\}
as.data.frame(fc) \%\textgreater\%
select(Quarter, .mean) \%\textgreater\%
rename(\texttt{Sales\ forecast} = .mean) \%\textgreater\%
knitr::kable(booktabs=TRUE, digits=1,
caption = ``Forecasts for the next year assuming Advertising budget and GDP are unchanged.'')

Again, notice the use of labels and references to automatically generate table numbers.

Figure \ref{fig:deaths} shows time plots of the data we just loaded.
