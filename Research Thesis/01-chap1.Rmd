# Introduction 

## Research Objective

This thesis aims to investigate the determinants behind, and evidence for the forecast combination puzzle in various domains. The combination puzzle refers to the well-known empirical finding that an equally weighted combination of forecasts generally outperforms more sophisticated combination schemes. While this phenomenon is often referenced in the point forecast combinations literature, it is also present in the literature on density forecast combinations. Starting with two different types of time series datasets, several two-model pools are constructed to explore how the presence of the puzzle is correlated with the in-sample performance of the constituent models. 

The empirical studies undertaken so far have focused more on pure time series settings, while there is little literature on the puzzle in the cross-sectional setting. A simulated study is designed to investigate the puzzle in the two-model pool under a regression analysis. In addition, we can derive and obtain a closed-form expression to support findings in the simple regression case. Throughout, we measure the performance of density combinations via the log score function and use mean squared forecast error to assess the accuracy of point combinations.





## Literature Review and Motivation

Forecast accuracy is of critical concern for forecasters and decision makers. The application of forecast combination, originally proposed in the seminal work of @BG69, provides the evidence of dramatic improvements in forecast accuracy, and therefore has attracted wide attention and contributions in the literature, both theoretical and applied [@C89;@T06]. More importantly, this approach often has robust performance across various types of data, proved by numerous empirical results [@GA11]. A prominence of researchers also devote efforts on probabilistic forecasting to obtain more information about the uncertainty of the resulting forecast. Similar to point forecasts, researchers now found that density forecast combination outperforms individual density forecast [e.g., @HM07;@GA11].



Forecast combination methods, in general, involve combining multiple forecasts generated from individual or constituent models based on a rule or weighting scheme. Every scheme has its own objective function for producing the "best" forecast combination, along with the optimal weight assigned to each model. This process can sometimes capture more meaningful characteristics of the true data generating process than using a single model, and allows us to combine the best features of different models within a single framework. Researchers have examined a variety of combination methods for both point and density forecasts over the past 50 years, see @WHLK22 for a modern literature review.

In most time series setting under which forecast combinations are employed, a striking empirical phenomenon is often observed, coined by @SW04, as the "forecast combination puzzle". The puzzle is encapsulated by the fact that "theoretically sophisticated weighting schemes should provide more benefits than the simple average from forecast combination, while empirically the simple average has been continuously found to dominate more complicated approaches to combining forecasts" [@WHLK22]. In other words, complex weighting schemes are designed to improve in-sample accuracy, so these refined forecast combinations should perform better out-of-sample in theory. However, the mean of the contemporaneous forecasts appears to be more robust in practice than forecasts combined through complicated weighting schemes. This finding has been continuously reaffirmed by extensive literature reviews and papers [e.g., @MACF82; @C89; @MSA18; @MSA20], and the simple averaging naturally becomes a benchmark. In this thesis, the forecast combination puzzle is loosely defined as the forecast accuracy between the optimal combination and the simple average being small. We allow the optimal combination to be slightly higher than the simple average and treat it as evidence of the puzzle. As their forecast accuracy is not too different, using either combination method will not make a huge difference, except in special circumstances where a small change in accuracy matters a lot.



The literature explains the puzzle mainly in three aspects: the estimation uncertainty in complicated weighting schemes [@SW98; @SW04; @SW09], the bias and inefficiency in the Mean Squared Forecast Error (MSFE) function [@E11; @CMVW16], and the sampling variability of the forecasts induced via estimation of the constituent model forecasts [@ZMFP22; @FZMP23]. However, all of these explanations implicitly assume that the puzzle will be in evidence when combining forecasts, regardless of the choice of constituent models or the weighing scheme. They overlook the possibility that complicated combination methods can perform much better than the simple average in some cases. In order to make a rigorous explanation statement, we systematically explore the determinants behind the presence of the puzzle. Even though there is a widespread literature among different pure time series settings, no attention appears to have been given to the cross-sectional setting. Therefore, we will investigate this in both time series and cross-sectional settings using empirical and simulated data respectively.



Following the idea of "linear opinion pool" [@HM07;@GA11] and considering a simple case of two-model combination, our initial conjecture is that the presence of the puzzle is highly related to the in-sample fit of two constituent models. When constituent models have similar in-sample fit, the puzzle will be in evidence. Otherwise, the presence of the puzzle is uncertain. Intuitively, the model in-sample performance greatly affects the behavior of forecasts, so forecasts produced by two similarly performed models will not differ much, leading the estimated optimal weight to be around a half. Therefore, it is reasonable to use the simple average method given that the mean of two forecasts is a good estimate and, more importantly, the forecast variance will be halved with no extra parameter estimation. Consequently, we should expect a small difference of the forecast accuracy between the simple averaging and the sophisticated weighting scheme, which is known as the forecast combination puzzle. On the contrary, if two models have distinct in-sample fit, the optimal forecast combination will give more weight to the better one and therefore both weights will be far away from a half. The presence of the puzzle now becomes ambiguous because there are two possible situations in this case, one is that the simple average forecast perform much better than the optimal combination forecast, and the other one is the opposite. By definition, the puzzle is apparently evident in the first case and hard to argue in the second case. Table \ref{tab:1} summarizes the hypothesis. Two constituent models are evaluated based on their in-sample performance in a relative sense, and are also allowed to perform equivalently ``Bad`` for different reasons.

\end{tabular}
\caption{The first row and the first column refer to two constituent models in a combination, $M_1$ and $M_2$. ``Good`` means that the model fits the data well, whereas ``Bad`` denotes that the model fails to capture some important features of the data. The ``$\surd$`` indicates the presence of the forecast combination puzzle, while ``$?$`` implies that the presence of the puzzle is uncertain.}

We revisit the forecast combination puzzle in the pure time series setting by fitting and combining different classes of models. At the first glance, the puzzle is evident in all the combinations but under two situations: 1) the accuracy difference between the average forecast and the optimal combination forecast is small; and 2) the accuracy of the average forecast is much higher than that of the optimal combination forecast. With further comparison and analysis, we summarize the relationship between the in-sample fit of two constituent models and the presence of the puzzle, which matches with our conjecture. The difficulty with empirical data where the true data generating process (DGP) is unknown can be solved by conducting a simulation study. Therefore, we investigate the forecasting performance of two-model pools for simulated cross-sectional data in using simple linear regression models. We derive the mathematical relationship between the optimal weight and elements in the true DGP under the mean squared forecast error. It illustrates the determinants of the estimated optimal weight and implies that the forecast combination puzzle is more about the interaction of constituent models with the true DGP. Given the knowledge in point combinations, we apply it to the density combinations and validate that these formal reasoning can be used to interpret empirical findings. In addition, this simulation study provides sufficient empirical evidence to examine conjecture.



The goal of this thesis is two-fold: first, to substantiate the presence of the combination puzzle in the time series setting and to explore the relationship between the puzzle and the in-sample fit of constituent models; second, to mathematically derive the formula of the optimal weight in the regression setting under mean squared forecast error and then to validate the conjecture in Table \ref{tab:1} with empirical evidence.

The thesis follows two common weighting schemes for `two model` pools (Section 2) and then applies the log score to density combinations for daily S\&P 500 index and the mean squared error to point combinations for quarterly number of unemployed (Section 3). With some empirical evidence of the conjecture, Section 4 derives a closed-form expression for the optimal weight under the mean squared error in a simple regression case. The findings are further examined by density combinations in the cross-sectional setting. The final section concludes.
