# Empirical Results

## Pure time series setting (S\&P 500)  

Reconsidering the example in Section 3 of @GA11, the data we use is the daily Standard and Poor's (S\&P) 500 index from February 11, 2013 to February 10, 2023 (10 years in total), retrieved from the @SP500. The S&P500 index dataset has a total of 2519 ($T$) observations and is partitioned into two periods with a rough proportion. The in-sample period contains the first 60% of the data ($R = 1511$), which is used to estimate all unknown parameters, including the optimal weight. The remaining 40% ($P = 1008$) becomes the out-of-sample period to evaluate the forecast performance.  

We will investigate the presence of the forecast combination puzzle when using correctly-specified models or mis-specified models to fit the data. Constituent models are based on common classes of models: autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing (ETS), and linear regression model with ARIMA errors. Detailed model specifications for each case will be clarified in the corresponding section.  


To start with, 

We choose $j=1,\cdots,M$, with $M=3$ prediction models to study the performance of density predictions across sets of ``two-model`` pools. Each of the $j$ predictive model has a conditional Gaussian density, which takes the form $f^{(j)}(y)=f_j(y_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})=N\{y_t; \mu_j, \sigma^2_j\}$, where $N\{x; \mu, \sigma^2\}$ denotes the normal probability density function evaluated at value $x$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. The notation $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$ denotes all information available at time $t-1$, and we assume that the conditional mean and variance of the models are, up to unknown parameters, known at time $t-1$.



### Fitting the nonstationary time series

To reduce the level of variability, we take a natural logarithm of the S\&P 500 index $y_t$ and fit the data directly without removing its stochastic trend with three candidate models.

1. Model 1: ARIMA(1,1,1) model with an intercept of the natural logarithm of S\&P 500 index. 
\begin{equation*}
log(y_t) = c + log(y_{t-1}) + \phi_1\big[log(y_{t-1})-log(y_{t-2})\big] + \epsilon_t + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1}
\end{equation*}

2. Model 2: ETS(M,N,N) model of the natural logarithm of S\&P 500 index. 
\begin{align*}
log(y_t) &= \ell_{t-1} (1+\epsilon_t) \\
\ell_t &= \ell_{t-1} (1+\alpha \epsilon_t) \\
\end{align*}

3. Model 3: A linear regression model of the natural logarithm of the S\&P 500 index and ARIMA(1,0,0) errors. 
\begin{align*}
log(y_t) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + u_t \\
u_t &= \phi_1 u_{t-1} + \epsilon_t
\end{align*}

The error term, $\epsilon_t$, in each model is assumed to be independent and normally distributed with a zero mean and a constant variance.

    \multicolumn{4}{l}{\footnotesize Entries below diagonal show the estimated weight of the model in that column in the two-model pool.}\\
    \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:2}
\end{table}

There are 3 sets of two-model combination and the log predictive score of each combination is generated according to \ref{eqn:LS} with the value of weight changing by 0.01 every time. Table \ref{tab:2} shows the estimated weights and combination log scores.

There are then four combined forecasts whose MSFEs are calculated over the last P observations: three weighted averages, in turn using and the observed and truncated, and the simple average using
